Hey people, Welcome to our challenge !

So there will be several steps for you to go through before completing the challenge,
and each one of them is necessary for the next step to work so dont skip any steps !

First stage

 - Try to fetch the jokes from he following api "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/"
 - The starter code is already provided in JokeList.jsx. Go through it
